# Malware Classification System

A Python-based Malware Classification System utilizing Support Vector Machines (SVM).

## Introduction

This project aims to classify executable files (.exe or .dll) as either Malicious or Goodware using machine learning techniques, specifically Support Vector Machines. The system provides a user-friendly graphical interface for uploading files, training the model, classifying files, and adding new data to the dataset.

## Classifier Overview

Files are classified based on features extracted using PEview. The classifier utilizes SVM to distinguish between Malicious and Goodware files. 

## Training Process

The system employs a Test-Train Split methodology for model validation, ensuring robust classification performance.
